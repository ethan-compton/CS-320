How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality and security, I wrote unit tests for individual methods and validated inputs to prevent potential bugs and vulnerabilities. Using JUnit helped me verify that my code behaved as expected, while also giving me confidence to refactor when needed. Secure coding practices—such as input validation and limiting exposure of sensitive data—helped protect the program from unintended behavior or misuse.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user needs meant thinking about how the end user would interact with the program. For the contact service, that involved ensuring proper name and phone number formats, clear error messages, and reliable performance. I translated these expectations into code by following requirements closely, planning the logic carefully, and testing for edge cases that a user might encounter.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by first breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts. I focus on modular code with well-named methods and consistent structure. This helps with both readability and maintenance. I also try to plan ahead before coding—thinking about the flow of data and how different parts of the program interact—so the result is easier to understand and extend later.
